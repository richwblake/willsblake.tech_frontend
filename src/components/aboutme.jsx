                <p>I am a software engineer specializing in Python and Flask with an overall goal of writing robust and easy to understand software. I believe that working with a group of curious and hardworking people is the best way to accomplish this. I am passionate about working as a team player, and find that putting my needs aside and prioritizing the needs of the group helps us all be the best team possible.</p>
                <p>I am currently working with several clients local to the Tampa Bay area to provide web development and hosting services to their businesses. I build full stack web applications to facilitate any desires from my clients. These applications range from "About the Company" websites to more complex applications requiring backend database persistence and mailing capabilities. My motto is "If you can think it, I can build it for you".</p>
